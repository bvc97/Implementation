# Implementation

This project contains the main implementation of my Dissertation which aims to make objects float realistically. 
Faced with the problem of few literature about this type of simulation, the objective is to have an algorithm focused on simplicity, but one that is as robust and realistic as possible, being able to demonstrate a good representation of the buoyancy of objects according to their mass and the forces that are exerted. 

The implementation was done in CPU with OpenGL and in GPU with shaders. The models are made in Blender.
The folder CPU_implementation contains 2 source codes where source_final_cpu is the CPU implementation and source is the GPU implementation.
The folders shaders and shaders_ contain the shaders with the non-instantiated rendering and the instantiated rendering which is done in the main and main_ files, respectively. 

This project was made on Microsoft Visual Studio.
