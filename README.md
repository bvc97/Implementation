# Implementation

This project contains the main implementation of my Dissertation which aims to make objects float realistically. 
Faced with the problem of few literature about this type of simulation, the objective is to have an algorithm focused on simplicity, but one that is as robust and realistic as possible, being able to demonstrate a good representation of the buoyancy of objects according to their mass and the forces that are exerted. 

The implementation was done in CPU with OpenGL and in GPU with shaders. The models are made in Blender.
The folder CPU_implementation contains 2 builds where build1 is the CPU implementation and build5 is the GPU implementation.

This project was made on Microsoft Visual Studio.
